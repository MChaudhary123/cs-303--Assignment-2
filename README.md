# cs-303--Assignment-2

This project provides a C++ implementation of two essential data structures:

One Linked List template
An integer stack with a vector from the Standard Template Library (STL)

For Linked List  - 

A data structure that is dynamic and has flexible operations
Templated design that accommodates various data formats
comprehensive techniques, such as:

Placement (front, rear, at a certain index)
deletion (at a particular index, front, and back)
Operations for search and retrieval
Error management for edge situations

The Integer Stack

Vector-based stack implementation that is efficient Core stack operations:

Retrieving Push Pop Top elements
Average computation
checking the empty status
